<p>
Hi! My hame is Faith Denise D. Laylay. I'm 13 years old. I was born on February 9, 2007 at <br>
Poctoy, Torijos Marinduque. I am a joyful, happy, shy and friendly person. I like reading books, <br>
drawing, painting, and i love to spend my free time playing with my younger brother, and i look <br>
for positivity in all things. <br>
</p>

<p>
I study at Divine Light Academy as one of the 8th grade students. I like things that are minimalist. <br>
I like being productive everyday so that i won't be lazy. I don't really have a lot of friends and <br>
that's fine with me, but i would like to make new friends. I consider myself as shy person to people <br>
that aren't close to me. <br>
